          <h2>The Misadventures of the Lollypop Thief</h2>
          <h5>Another Triumph of James "Jimmy" McGill,, Dec 7, 2007</h5>
          <div class="fakeimg" style="height: 200px"><img src="../assets/images/monkey_lollypop.jpg" alt="monkey with lollypop" class="resp-fake"></div>
      
          <p>
            In the heart of Jungle Haven Zoo, amidst the chatter of exotic
            creatures and the rustle of leaves, a mischievous capuchin monkey
            named Charlie was notorious for his love of mischief. His playful
            antics often entertained visitors, but sometimes they led to
            unexpected escapades.
          </p>

          <p>
            One sunny afternoon, young Timmy clutched his cherished lollypop as
            he marveled at the monkeys swinging from branch to branch. Little
            did he know that Charlie, the cheeky capuchin, had his eyes set on
            that gleaming, sugary treasure.
          </p>

          <p>
            With a swift swoop, Charlie descended from his treetop perch, his
            nimble fingers reaching for the tantalizing lollypop. In a blink,
            the unsuspecting Timmy found himself engaged in a tug-of-war with
            the pint-sized pilferer.
          </p>

          <p>
            The commotion caught the attention of Timmy's mother, who, startled
            by the sight of a mischievous monkey engaged in a lollypop heist,
            rushed to her son's aid. With a mix of concern and amusement, she
            attempted to negotiate with the rascally thief. The monkey fled with
            the lollypop and left the boy in tears.
          </p>
          <p>
            Timmy's mother was upset and sued the zoo. James "Jimmy" McGill
            assisted her in court and succesfully won the process where she'd
            get 100.000 dollars and a bag with new lollypops. She gave the
            lollypops to Jimmy and he replied: "Strawberry is my favorite, thanks Charlie!".
          </p>

          <p><em>To protect the privacy of the monkey a pseudonym is used.</em></p>
